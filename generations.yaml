    description: "The first-generation SEAT Alhambra was a full-size MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) developed as part of a joint venture between the Volkswagen Group and Ford, resulting in three nearly identical vehicles: the SEAT Alhambra, Volkswagen Sharan, and Ford Galaxy. Built at the AutoEuropa plant in Portugal, the Alhambra featured a conventional minivan design with sliding rear doors and seating for up to seven passengers in a 2-3-2 configuration. Engine options varied throughout its long production run but typically included gasoline options ranging from 1.8 to 2.8 liters (including a 1.8T turbocharged variant) and diesel engines from 1.9 to 2.0 liters with various power outputs, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The Alhambra underwent a significant facelift in 2000, receiving updated exterior styling, improved interior materials, and enhanced safety features. Despite being one of the older designs in its segment by the end of its run, the first-generation Alhambra maintained popularity thanks to its spacious interior, practical sliding doors, and relative value compared to its Volkswagen sibling. Throughout its 14-year production span—unusually long for a modern vehicle—the Alhambra received numerous minor updates to keep it competitive, including improved engines, additional equipment, and enhanced safety features. As SEAT's first and only MPV, the Alhambra established the Spanish brand's presence in the family vehicle segment across European markets."

  - name: "Second Generation"

    description: "The second-generation SEAT Alhambra represented a complete redesign, now based on the Volkswagen Group's more modern PQ46 platform shared with the contemporary Volkswagen Sharan but no longer related to Ford's offerings. The new Alhambra maintained the practical sliding rear door design of its predecessor while adopting SEAT's more angular styling language. Slightly larger than the outgoing model in all dimensions, the new Alhambra offered improved interior space with a flexible seating system accommodating up to seven passengers, with the third row suitable for adults—uncommon in the segment. Engine options centered around the Volkswagen Group's 1.4 TSI and 2.0 TSI gasoline engines and the 2.0 TDI diesel in various power outputs ranging from 140 to 220 horsepower, paired with six-speed manual or DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The interior featured a significant upgrade in material quality and technology, with available features including three-zone climate control, panoramic sunroof, and later SEAT's Full Link infotainment system with smartphone integration. Safety technology expanded to include optional adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, automatic emergency braking, and various parking assistance systems. A minor facelift in 2015 brought updated styling, improved engines meeting Euro 6 emissions standards, LED taillights, and enhanced infotainment options. Despite the market shift toward SUVs and crossovers, the second-generation Alhambra maintained steady sales thanks to its practical design, spacious interior, and strong value proposition. Production ended in 2022 without a direct replacement, reflecting the declining MPV market as family buyers increasingly favored SUV-style vehicles."
